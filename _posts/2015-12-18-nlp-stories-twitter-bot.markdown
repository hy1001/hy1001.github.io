<img src="/images/fulls/twit.png" class="fit image"> So sometime last week, as I was studing for the finals, I was distracted and thought it would be nice to make a Twitter bot tweetting about natural language processing. Since my plan is to have a NLP project either with Raspberry Pi or on Web over the winter break, it would be nice to have something automatically gather information for me. So I made one. Thanks to [Mark Rabey](http://markrabey.com/2014/05/09/build-a-twitter-bot-with-node-js/), it was easy enough to develop and deploy on heroku. Of course, heroku has that limited usage in a day and it automatically sleeps unless checked. So I used something call [StatusCake](https://www.statuscake.com/App/YourStatus.php) that checks my web periodically by the time I set, which is kind of cool and free.
Now it's tweeting about basically three keywords: 1) Natural Language Processing or NLP, 2) Deep Learning and every one in a while 3) Speech Recognition. I think I might make some adjustments to make it a litle smarter than just retweeting but that's going to be after the finals.
