<img src="/images/fulls/scribble.jpg" class="fit image"> Finally setted up my blog. It took me a great deal of time to figure out which website generator to use. I've had some expriences with WordPress which I am using as a travelog and a diary. But I wanted something lighter, static, and simple that I can put up on GitHub. Hexo and Jekyll seemed to be the perfect match. Well then, which one between them?

Similar aspects are shared, such as Markdown support. It is great Hexo is built with Node.js which I am more familiar with than Ruby. However due to its recent birth, Hexo, at the moment, possesses fewer themes available and has a smaller community than Jekyll. Plus, I found this nice and simple theme made by [muan](https://github.com/muan). So, for now, at least, I'm going with Jekyll.
