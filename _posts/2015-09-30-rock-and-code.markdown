<img src="/images/fulls/rock.jpg" class="fit image"> Rock & Code Developer Weekend Contest happened last weekend. Although I am still recovirng from those sleepless nights, I am also happy that I have successfully managed my first hackathon. Yes, my first hackathon. Much emphasis on that. 

Since it was my first one, I got anxious and all. What to bring, what to prepare, what I should know before start, I just couldn't stop worrying. But at the end of the day, I found myself just purely enjoying the event! The food was amazing, the people were so nice, my team was awesome, and most of all, I was making something cool. So why not just have fun and code. 

Our project was a foreign music streaming web app. After all the whole event was about music and the industry with it, so we had the idea to design a streaming app for foreing music that isn't really spotlighted here in the US and for those who would like some foreign music. It didn't go all sweetly and merriely. Bring in d3.js features to our app was a pain. None of us had a deep understanding or previous experiences with d3.js but it still seemed to have some great animated features that we could implement. Along the way we even had to redesign the main streaming page. But at the end of the day, we won the 3rd place, which was toally unexpected and went home like a great warrior. Will I be attending more hackathons in the future? Absolutely.
